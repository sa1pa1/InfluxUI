# InfluxUI
This is the client side for my InfluxBD project. 

Collaborated with a team to develop a user-centric single-page application with dynamic UIs, including drag-and-drop
functionalities to assist users without database programming experience to generate and analyse Flux queries.
The key features implemented were a hierarchical query-building interface with intuitive Bucket-Measurement-Field-
Filter components, real-time query translation display, and data charts/ graphs with customisable filtering options. This
simplified the approach for users to generate data visualisation of complex Flux queries efficiently with no experience.

Collaborators: Samuel Beahan, Nathan Huy Dang-Huynh, Yuvraj Singh Anand, Pham Phuong Ngan Bui, Achyutha Muthya Nagaraj, Edward Praschifka, Dhakshith Ravikumar
